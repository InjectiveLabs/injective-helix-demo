      WINNER SELECTION AND NOTIFICATION:
    </h3>
    <p class="mb-4">
      After the end of the Competition Period, the Sponsor will conduct a random
      drawing or drawings to determine the Winner or Winners. The odds of
      winning in the Competition will depend on the number of eligible Entries
      submitted.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4">
      Winners will be notified in the following manner, within 30 days following
      the end of the Competition Period:
    </p>

    <ol class="list-decimal list-inside mb-4">
      <li class="mb-2">
        Entrants who traded on the Application (Helix) during the Competition
        should connect to the Application with their wallets after the
        Competition Period. The Entrant is solely responsible for complying with
        these instructions.
      </li>

      <li class="mb-2">
        If an Entrant who entered the Competition by submitting a form is chosen
        as a Winner, such Entrant will be notified directly by the Sponsor using
        the contact information submitted by the Entrant on his or her form and
        provided with instructions for claiming their Prize. The Entrant is
        solely responsible for complying with these instructions.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p class="mb-4">
      Winners shall have ten (10) days following the date that notifications are
      sent to them by the Sponsor to comply with the General Prize Conditions,
      including the KYC/AML requirements set forth herein.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4">
      Sponsor shall have no liability for any notification to winners that is
      lost, intercepted or not received by the potential winners for any reason.
      If a potential winner does not respond within the time required by
      Sponsor, or if the notification is returned as unclaimed or undeliverable
      to any potential winner, such potential winner will forfeit his or her
      potential prize and a second random drawing will be conducted to determine
      an alternate Winner. If any potential winner is found to be ineligible or
      if he or she has not complied with these Rules or declines the prize for
      any reason, such potential winner will be disqualified and alternate
      winners may be selected, as described above.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-lg font-bold mb-2 uppercase">PRIZES:</h3>
    <p class="mb-4">
      Subject to compliance with these Rules, including but not limited to the
      General Prize Conditions:
    </p>

    <p class="mb-2">
      (a) after the Competition Period, a random drawing or drawings will be
      conducted to determine 50 Winners, who will each receive $1,000, subject
      to these Rules;
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4">
      (b) The Sponsor may, in its sole discretion, decide to offer additional
      prizes. These Rules will be updated to add a description of any such
      prizes, if applicable.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-lg font-bold mb-2 uppercase">DISCLAIMER OF SPONSORSHIP:</h3>
    <p class="mb-4">
      The Competition is not in any way sponsored, endorsed, administered by, or
      associated with (a) Porsche, or any of its affiliated entities; or (b) X
      Holdings Corp, X Corp., or any of their affiliated entities.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-lg font-bold mb-2 uppercase">GENERAL PRIZE CONDITIONS:</h3>
    <p class="mb-4">
      No substitution of prizes will be allowed, except Sponsor reserves the
      right in its sole discretion to substitute prizes of comparable value if
      any prize listed is unavailable, in whole or in part, for any reason.
      Prizes will be awarded only if the potential prize winner fully complies
      with these Rules. All Prizes are non-assignable and non-transferable. All
      details and other restrictions of the prizes not specified in these Rules
      will be determined by Sponsor in its sole discretion. Each winner shall be
      solely responsible for all applicable taxes, and the reporting
      consequences thereof, and for any other fees or costs associated with the
      applicable prize. The winners may be required to execute an Affidavit of
      Eligibility, including among other things a certification that they have
      complied with these Rules, a Publicity Release (where imposing such
      condition is legal), and such other documents as Sponsor may determine in
      its sole discretion (collectively “Prize Claim Documents”). If any
      potential winner fails or refuses to sign and return all Prize Claim
      Documents within ten (10) days of prize notification, the winner may be
      disqualified and an alternate winner may be selected.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4">
      Prior to and as a mandatory pre-condition of receiving a prize, Winners
      must complete all forms, documents, processes and procedures, including,
      for the avoidance of doubt, any electronic verification system or process,
      which the Sponsor determines, in its sole discretion, are reasonably
      necessary for the Sponsor to comply with applicable anti-money laundering
      and “know your customer” laws. If any potential Winner fails or refuses to
      comply with the foregoing requirements within ten (10) days of prize
      notification, the Winner may be disqualified and an alternate winner may
      be selected.

      Except where prohibited, Entrants agree that (i): any and all disputes,
      claims, and causes of action arising out of or connected with the
      Competition promotion, or any prize awarded, or the determination of the
      winner shall be resolved individually, without resort to any form of class
      action; (ii) any and all claims, judgments and awards shall be limited to
      actual out-of-pocket costs incurred, including costs associated with
      entering the Competition promotion, but in no event attorney’s fees; and
      (iii) under no circumstances will Entrants be permitted to obtain awards
      for, and Entrants hereby waive all rights to claim, punitive, incidental
      and consequential damages and any other damages, other than for actual

      or the rights and obligations of Entrant and Releasees in connection with
      the Competition, shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with,
      the internal laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to rules

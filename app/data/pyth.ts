10. RISKS

10.1. By utilizing the Services or interacting with the Site in any way, you represent and warrant that you understand the inherent risks associated with cryptographic systems and blockchain-based networks (including, without limitation, sudden changes in operating rules, such as those commonly referred to as “forks,” and advances in code cracking or other technical advancements, such as the development of quantum computers, which may materially affect the Services); Digital Assets, including the usage and intricacies of native Digital Assets; smart contract-based tokens, such as those that are built on the Cosmos SDK; and systems that interact with blockchain-based networks. Injective does not own or control any of the underlying software through which blockchain networks are formed. In general, the software underlying blockchain networks, including the Injective blockchain, is open source, such that anyone can use, copy, modify, and distribute it.

10.2. The Services and your Digital Assets could be impacted by one or more regulatory inquiries or regulatory actions, which may require us to, upon request by government agencies, take certain actions or provide information, which may not be in your best interest or could impede or limit the ability of Injective to continue to make available its proprietary software and, thus, could impede or limit your ability to access or use the Services.

10.3. You understand that the Injective blockchain remains under development, which creates technological and security risks when using the Services in addition to uncertainty relating to Digital Assets and transactions therein. You acknowledge that the cost of transacting on the Injective blockchain is variable and may increase at any time causing impact to any activities taking place on the Injective blockchain, which may result in price fluctuations or increased costs when using the Services.

10.4. Although we intend to provide accurate and timely information on the Site and during your use of the Services, the Site and other information available when using the Services may not always be entirely accurate, complete, or current and may also include technical inaccuracies or typographical errors. To continue to provide you with as complete and accurate information as possible, information may be changed or updated from time to time without notice, including, without limitation, information regarding our policies. Accordingly, you should verify all information before relying on it, and all decisions based on information contained on the Site or as part of the Services are your sole responsibility. No representation is made as to the accuracy, completeness, or appropriateness for any particular purpose of any pricing information distributed via the Site or otherwise when using the Services. Prices and pricing information may be higher or lower than prices available on platforms providing similar services.

10.5. Any use or interaction with the Services requires an understanding of applied cryptography and computer science to appreciate the inherent risks, including those listed above. You represent and warrant that you possess relevant knowledge and skills. Any reference to a type of Digital Asset on the Site or otherwise during the use of the Services does not indicate our approval or disapproval of the technology on which the Digital Asset relies, and should not be used as a substitute for your understanding of the risks specific to each type of Digital Asset.

10.6. Use of the Services, including, without limitation, for trading Digital Assets and entering into derivatives contracts, may carry financial risk. Digital Assets are, by their nature, highly experimental, risky, and volatile. Transactions entered into in connection with the Services are irreversible and final and there are no refunds. You acknowledge and agree that you will access and use the Site and the Services at your own risk. The risk of loss in trading Digital Assets, especially when trading on margin, can be substantial. You should, therefore, carefully consider whether such trading is suitable for you in light of your circumstances and financial resources. By using the Services, you represent and warrant that you have been, are, and will be solely responsible for making your independent appraisal and investigations into the risks of a given transaction and the underlying Digital Assets, including any margin. You represent that you have sufficient knowledge, market sophistication, professional advice, and experience to make your evaluation of the merits and risks of any transaction conducted in connection with the Services or any Digital Asset. You accept all consequences of using the Services, including the risk that you may lose access to your Digital Assets indefinitely. All transaction decisions are made solely by you. Notwithstanding anything in these Terms, we accept no responsibility whatsoever for, and will in no circumstances be liable to you in connection with, your use of the Services for performing Digital Asset transactions, including entering into margin position or derivative or swap contracts.

10.7. You hereby assume and agree that Injective will have no responsibility or liability for the risks set forth in this Section 10. You hereby irrevocably waive, release and discharge all claims, whether known or unknown to you, against Injective, its affiliates, and their respective shareholders, members, directors, officers, employees, agents, and representatives, suppliers, and contractors related to any of the risks set forth in this Section 10.

11. INDEMNIFICATION

You will defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Injective, its affiliates, and its affiliates’ respective stockholders, members, directors, officers, managers, employees, attorneys, agents, representatives, suppliers, and contractors (collectively, “Indemnified Parties”) from any claim, demand, lawsuit, action, proceeding, investigation, liability, damage, loss, cost or expense, including without limitation reasonable attorneys’ fees, arising out of or relating to (a) your use of, or conduct in connection with, the Site or the Services; (b) Digital Assets associated with your blockchain address or wallet for which you are the/a beneficial owner; (c) any feedback or user content you provide to Injective, if any, concerning the Site or the Services; (d) your violation of these Terms; or (e) your infringement or misappropriation of the rights of any other person or entity.

In no event shall Injective, its affiliates, its suppliers and contractors, and its affiliates’, suppliers’ and contractors’ respective stockholders, members, directors, officers, managers, employees, attorneys, agents, representatives, suppliers, and contractors (collectively, the “Risk Limited Parties”) be liable for any incidental, indirect, special, punitive, consequential or similar damages or liabilities whatsoever (including, without limitation, damages for loss of fiat, assets, data, information, revenue, opportunities, use, goodwill, profits or other business or financial benefit) arising out of or in connection with the Site and the Services, any execution or settlement of a transaction, any performance or non-performance of the Services, your Digital Assets, margin positions, derivative contracts, or any other product, service or other item provided by or on behalf of Injective, whether under contract, tort (including negligence), civil liability, statute, strict liability, breach of warranties, or under any other theory of liability, and whether or not we have been advised of, knew of or should have known of the possibility of such damages and notwithstanding any failure of the essential purpose of these Terms or any limited remedy hereunder, nor is Injective in any way responsible for the execution or settlement of transactions between users of Injective-developed open-source software.

14. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

In no event shall Injective’s aggregate liability (together with its affiliates, including its and its affiliates’ respective stockholders, members, directors, managers, officers, employees, attorneys, agents, representatives, suppliers, or contractors) arising out of or in connection with the Site and the Services (and any of their content and functionality), any performance or nonperformance of the Services, your Digital Assets, margin positions, derivatives contracts, or any other product, service or other item provided by or on behalf of Injective, whether under contract, tort (including negligence), civil liability, statute, strict liability or other theory of liability exceed the amount of fees paid by you to Injective under these Terms, if any, in the twelve (12) month period immediately preceding the event giving rise to the claim for liability.

15. DISPUTE RESOLUTION & ARBITRATION

15.1. Please read the following section carefully because it requires you to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with Injective and limits how you can seek relief from Injective. PLEASE NOTE THAT ARBITRATION PRECLUDES YOU FROM SUING IN COURT OR HAVING A JURY TRIAL.

15.2. You and Injective agree that any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or the Services is personal to you and Injective and that any dispute will be resolved solely through individual action, and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action, or any other type of representative proceeding.

15.3. YOU AND INJECTIVE WAIVE YOUR RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL AND TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THESE TERMS OR THE SERVICES RESOLVED IN COURT. Instead, for any dispute or claim that you have against Injective or relating in any way to the Services, you agree to first contact Injective and attempt to resolve the claim informally by sending a written notice of your claim (“Notice”) to Injective by email at legal@injectivelabs.org. The Notice must (a) include your name, residence address, email address, and telephone number; (b) describe the nature and basis of the claim; and (c) set forth the specific relief sought. Our notice to you will be similar in form to that described above. If you and Injective cannot reach an agreement to resolve the claim within thirty (30) days after such Notice is received, then either party may submit the dispute to binding arbitration administered by JAMS. All disputes submitted to JAMS will be resolved through confidential, binding arbitration before one arbitrator. Arbitration proceedings will be held in New York, New York, under the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (“JAMS Rules”). The most recent version of the JAMS Rules are available on the JAMS website and are hereby incorporated by reference. You either acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the JAMS Rules or waive your opportunity to read the JAMS Rules and waive any claim that the JAMS Rules are unfair or should not apply for any reason.

15.4. The arbitrator, Injective, and you will maintain the confidentiality of any arbitration proceedings, judgments and awards, including, but not limited to, all information gathered, prepared, and presented for purposes of the arbitration or related to the dispute(s) therein. The arbitrator will have the authority to make appropriate rulings to safeguard confidentiality unless the law provides to the contrary. The duty of confidentiality does not apply to the extent that disclosure is necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits, in connection with a court application for a preliminary remedy or in connection with a judicial challenge to an arbitration award or its enforcement, or to the extent that disclosure is otherwise required by law or judicial decision.

15.5. You and Injective agree that for any arbitration you initiate, you will pay the filing fee and all other JAMS fees and costs. For any arbitration initiated by Injective, Injective will pay all JAMS fees and costs. You and Injective agree that the state or federal courts of the State of New York and the United States sitting in New York, New York have exclusive jurisdiction over the enforcement of an arbitration award.

15.6. Any claim arising out of or related to these Terms or the Services must be filed within one year after such claim arose; otherwise, the claim is permanently barred, which means that you and Injective will not have the right to assert the claim.

15.7. If any portion of this Section 15 is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, (a) the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall be severed from these Terms; (b) severance of the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall have no impact whatsoever on the remainder of this Section 15 or the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis under this Section 15; and (c) to the extent that any claims must therefore proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or representative basis, such claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration, and the parties agree that litigation of those claims shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration. Further, if any part of this Section 15 is found to prohibit an individual claim seeking public injunctive relief, then that provision will have no effect to the extent such relief is allowed to be sought out of arbitration, and the remainder of this Section 15 will be enforceable.

16. GOVERNING LAW

The interpretation and enforcement of these Terms, and any dispute related to these Terms, the Site or the Services, will be governed by and construed and enforced under the laws of the State of New York, as applicable, without regard to conflict of law rules or principles (whether of the State of New York or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction. You agree that we may initiate a proceeding related to the enforcement or validity of our intellectual property rights in any court having jurisdiction. For any other proceeding that is not subject to arbitration under these Terms, the state and federal courts located in New York, New York will have exclusive jurisdiction. You waive any objection to venue in any such courts.

The failure or delay of Injective in exercising any right, power, or privilege under these Terms shall not operate as a waiver thereof.

17.4. The invalidity or unenforceability of any of these Terms shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other of these Terms, all of which shall remain in full force and effect.

17.5. Headings of sections are for convenience only and shall not be used to limit or construe such sections.

17.6. These Terms contain the entire agreement between you and Injective and supersede all prior and contemporaneous understandings between the parties regarding the Site and the Services.

18. AFFILIATE ACTIVITY

A non-US affiliate of Injective accesses and uses the Services in the ordinary course of its Digital Asset trading business and receives fees in connection therewith, including through its participation in certain protocol-level market-marketing incentive programs made available by the Injective community. However, neither we, our affiliates, nor their employees have access to any unique trading information related to the use of the Services that would provide any unique or unfair advantage over any other user of the Services.

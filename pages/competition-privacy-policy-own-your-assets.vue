          form that does not permit identifying you when this information is no
          longer necessary for the purposes for which we process it, unless we
          are required or permitted by law to keep this information for a longer
          period. When determining the specific retention period, we take into
          account various criteria, such as the type of Services provided to
          you, the nature and length of our relationship with you, and mandatory
          retention periods provided by law and the relevant statute of
          limitations.

              In connection with your use of the Services, you are required to
              pay all fees necessary for interacting with certain blockchain
              networks, including, without limitation, the Injective blockchain.
              Such fees may include &ldquo;gas&rdquo; costs, as well as all
              other fees reflected on the Site at the time of your use of the
              Services, including trading fees and network access fees. You
              acknowledge and understand that Injective neither controls any of
              the foregoing fees nor does it receive fees in connection with the
              provision of the Services. An affiliate of Injective accesses and
              uses the Services in the ordinary course of its Digital Asset
              trading business and receives fees in connection therewith.
              Although we attempt to provide accurate fee information, this
              information reflects our estimates of fees, which may vary from
              the actual fees paid to interact with Injective or other
              blockchains.

              time without notice, including, without limitation, information
              regarding our policies. Accordingly, you should verify all
              information before relying on it, and all decisions based on
              information contained on the Site or as part of the Services are
              your sole responsibility. No representation is made as to the
              accuracy, completeness, or appropriateness for any particular
              purpose of any pricing information distributed via the Site or
              otherwise when using the Services. Prices and pricing information
              may be higher or lower than prices available on platforms
              providing similar services.

              10.5. Any use or interaction with the Services requires an
              understanding of applied cryptography and computer science to
              appreciate the inherent risks, including those listed above. You
              represent and warrant that you possess relevant knowledge and
              skills. Any reference to a type of Digital Asset on the Site or
              otherwise during the use of the Services does not indicate our
              approval or disapproval of the technology on which the Digital
              Asset relies, and should not be used as a substitute for your
              understanding of the risks specific to each type of Digital Asset.

              10.6. Use of the Services, including, without limitation, for
              trading Digital Assets and entering into derivatives contracts,
              may carry financial risk. Digital Assets are, by their nature,
              highly experimental, risky, and volatile. Transactions entered
              into in connection with the Services are irreversible and final
              and there are no refunds. You acknowledge and agree that you will
              access and use the Site and the Services at your own risk. The
              risk of loss in trading Digital Assets, especially when trading on
              margin, can be substantial. You should, therefore, carefully
              consider whether such trading is suitable for you in light of your
              circumstances and financial resources. By using the Services, you
              represent and warrant that you have been, are, and will be solely
              responsible for making your independent appraisal and
              investigations into the risks of a given transaction and the
              underlying Digital Assets, including any margin. You represent
              that you have sufficient knowledge, market sophistication,
              professional advice, and experience to make your evaluation of the
              merits and risks of any transaction conducted in connection with
              the Services or any Digital Asset. You accept all consequences of
              using the Services, including the risk that you may lose access to
              your Digital Assets indefinitely. All transaction decisions are
              made solely by you. Notwithstanding anything in these Terms, we
              accept no responsibility whatsoever for, and will in no
              circumstances be liable to you in connection with, your use of the
              Services for performing Digital Asset transactions, including
              entering into margin position or derivative or swap contracts.

              requires you to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with
              Injective and limits how you can seek relief from Injective.

              you agree to first contact Injective and attempt to resolve the

              describe the nature and basis of the claim; and (c) set forth the
              specific relief sought. Our notice to you will be similar in form

              15.4. The arbitrator, Injective, and you will maintain the
              confidentiality of any arbitration proceedings, judgments and
              awards, including, but not limited to, all information gathered,
              prepared, and presented for purposes of the arbitration or related
              to the dispute(s) therein. The arbitrator will have the authority
              to make appropriate rulings to safeguard confidentiality unless
              the law provides to the contrary. The duty of confidentiality does
              not apply to the extent that disclosure is necessary to prepare
              for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits, in
              connection with a court application for a preliminary remedy or in
              connection with a judicial challenge to an arbitration award or
              its enforcement, or to the extent that disclosure is otherwise
              required by law or judicial decision.

              15.5. You and Injective agree that for any arbitration you
              initiate, you will pay the filing fee and all other JAMS fees and
              costs. For any arbitration initiated by Injective, Injective will
              pay all JAMS fees and costs. You and Injective agree that the
              state or federal courts of the State of New York and the United
              States sitting in New York, New York have exclusive jurisdiction
              over the enforcement of an arbitration award.

              15.6. Any claim arising out of or related to these Terms or the
              Services must be filed within one year after such claim arose;
              otherwise, the claim is permanently barred, which means that you
              and Injective will not have the right to assert the claim.

              15.7. If any portion of this Section 15 is found to be
              unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, (a) the unenforceable or
              unlawful provision shall be severed from these Terms; (b)
              severance of the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall have no
              impact whatsoever on the remainder of this Section 15 or the
              parties' ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on
              an individual basis under this Section 15; and (c) to the extent
              that any claims must therefore proceed on a class, collective,
              consolidated, or representative basis, such claims must be
              litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in
              arbitration, and the parties agree that litigation of those claims
              shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in
              arbitration. Further, if any part of this Section 15 is found to
              prohibit an individual claim seeking public injunctive relief,
              then that provision will have no effect to the extent such relief
              is allowed to be sought out of arbitration, and the remainder of
              this Section 15 will be enforceable.

              by and construed and enforced under the laws of the State of New
              York, as applicable, without regard to conflict of law rules or
              principles (whether of the State of New York or any other
              jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any
              other jurisdiction. You agree that we may initiate a proceeding
              related to the enforcement or validity of our intellectual
              property rights in any court having jurisdiction. For any other
              proceeding that is not subject to arbitration under these Terms,
              the state and federal courts located in New York, New York will
              have exclusive jurisdiction. You waive any objection to venue in
              any such courts.
